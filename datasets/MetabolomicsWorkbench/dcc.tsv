cfde_registry_dcc:metabolomics	UCSD Metabolomics Workbench	MW	"The Metabolomics Workbench is the NIH Common Fund's National Metabolomics Data Repository (NMDR). The Metabolomics Workbench accepts metabolomics data for small and large studies on cells, tissues and organisms. We can accommodate a variety of metabolite analyses, including, but not limited to MS and NMR. In order to ensure reproducibility and interoperable use of data, we require experimental metadata to be deposited along with the metabolite measurements. Processed data (measurements) maybe in the form of quantitated metabolite concentrations, MS peak height/area values, LC retention times, NMR binned areas, etc. Raw data in the form of MS and NMR binary files and associated parameter files may also be uploaded. We accept data from both targeted and untargeted studies. The Metabolomics Workbench also provides a suite of tools for analysis and visualization of the data."	mmaurya@ucsd.edu	Mano Maurya	https://genome.ucsd.edu/	https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PPR00001

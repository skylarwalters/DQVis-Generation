OBI:0000366	metabolite profiling assay	An assay that detects and identifies chemical entities resulting from biochemical and cellular metabolism	["metabolite assay","metabolomic assay"]
OBI:0000615	protein expression profiling assay	An assay that determines protein expression and translation activity using protein extracts collected from a material entity.	["proteomic analysis"]
OBI:0001862	reduced representation bisulfite sequencing assay	A bisulfite sequencing assay that identifies genomic methylation patterns using a bisulfite based protocol that enriches CG-rich parts of the genome.	["reduced representation bisulfite-seq","RRBS","RRBS assay"]
OBI:0002773	single-value binding of antibody with reporter to antigen assay	An assay that detects the linking of antigens and antibodies via special signaling mechanisms, such as EIA, ELISA, chemiluminescence, etc. that produces one measure (quantitative or qualitative) of the analyte of interest	["IA","immunoassay"]
OBI:0003089	bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing	An assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing in which the sample that is sequenced is derived from a collection of cells, such as a tissue sample or entire cell culture, and therefore provides results representative of the aggregate of sample cells.	["bulk ATAC-seq"]
OBI:0003090	bulk RNA-seq assay	An RNA-seq assay in which the sample that is sequenced is derived from a collection of cells, such as a tissue sample or entire cell culture, and therefore provides results representative of the aggregate of sample cells.	[]

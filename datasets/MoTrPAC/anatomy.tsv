UBERON:0000956	cerebral cortex	The thin layer of gray matter on the surface of the cerebral hemisphere that develops from the telencephalon. It consists of the neocortex (6 layered cortex or isocortex), the hippocampal formation and the olfactory cortex.	["cortex of cerebral hemisphere"]

UBERON:0001155	colon	A portion of the large intestine before it becomes the rectum. In mammals, the colon is the most part of the large intestine, excluding the vermiform appendix, the rectum and the anal canal.	["large bowel"]
UBERON:0001347	white adipose tissue	Connective tissue consisting of fat-storing cells and arranged in lobular groups or along minor blood vessels.	["adipocytus unigutturalis","textus adiposus albus","unilocular adipose tissue","white fat"]
UBERON:0001348	brown adipose tissue	A thermogenic form of adipose tissue that is composed of brown adipocytes.	["adipocytus multigutturalis","brown fat","multilocular adipose tissue","textus adiposus fuscus"]
UBERON:0001379	vastus lateralis	The Vastus lateralis (Vastus externus) is the largest part of the Quadriceps femoris. It arises by a broad aponeurosis, which is attached to the upper part of the intertrochanteric line, to the anterior and inferior borders of the greater trochanter, to the lateral lip of the gluteal tuberosity, and to the upper half of the lateral lip of the linea aspera; this aponeurosis covers the upper three-fourths of the muscle, and from its deep surface many fibers take origin. A few additional fibers arise from the tendon of the Glutæus maximus, and from the lateral intermuscular septum between the Vastus lateralis and short head of the Biceps femoris. The fibers form a large fleshy mass, which is attached to a strong aponeurosis, placed on the deep surface of the lower part of the muscle: this aponeurosis becomes contracted and thickened into a flat tendon inserted into the lateral border of the patella, blending with the Quadriceps femoris tendon, and giving an expansion to the capsule of the knee-joint..	["lateralis","vastus lateralis muscle"]
UBERON:0001388	gastrocnemius	The most superficial muscle of the triceps surae group, in the posterior portion of the lower hindleg.	["gastrocnemius muscle","m. gastrocnemius","m.gastrocnemius"]
UBERON:0001898	hypothalamus	A specialized brain region of the ventral diencephalon arising near the end of the segmentation period; the embryonic hypothalamic region will give rise to the posterior pituitary gland as well as a number of brain nuclei.. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis)..

[]
UBERON:0002108	small intestine	Subdivision of digestive tract that connects the stomach to the large intestine and is where much of the digestion and absorption of food takes place (with the exception of ruminants). The mammalian small intestine is long and coiled and can be differentiated histologically into: duodenum, jejunem, ileum.	["small bowel","small intestine"]

["glandula adrenalis","glandula suprarenalis"]
UBERON:0004087	vena cava	Any of the veins that carries deoxygenated blood from a part of the body into the right atrium of the heart.	[]
